            brought her years of operations and IT experience to help maintain
            and grow our business operations. Natalie did more than lead the
            operations and growth of our business though. Natalie took
            initiative to continually solve our customers challenges, she
            implemented processes and created training/on-boarding material for
            new hires, she helped guide our engineer and product teams and most
            importantly was a great team player that had a positive impact to
            company culture. I would highly recommend Natalie and would
            certainly work with her again if given the opportunity.""

            extremely professional and positive attitude while navigating both
            the internal and external sell. Natalieâ€™s ability to identify
            opportunities and properly position solutions was instrumental in
            putting together several long term growth strategies in place. She
            has an extremely high tolerance for ambiguity and a calm and

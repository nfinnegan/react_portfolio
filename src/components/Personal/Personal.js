                ðŸ‘‹ I am originally from a southwest suburb of Chicago. After
                spending some time living in the city after college, I lived in
                Los Angeles for a bit and currently reside in Denver, CO. I am a
                first generation college graduate and take a lot of pride in
                that. I am a quick-witted, empathetic and compassionate person.
                I've taken a liking to hiking, love trying new restaurants and
                traveling (favorite country so far is Italy). I try to do those
                things as much as I can.
